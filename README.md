I came across this idea when I notice that my father was tasked to fill in the blood pressure form by the polyclinic, a routine that requires him to take readings three times a day; morning, afternoon and evening. Besides the recording the blood pressure reading, the form has a table for body weight. It requires at least one reading month. The form will be given to the Doctor for review during the next checkup.

The form given by the polyclinic has rows sufficient for up to 1 month of blood pressure reading. When the rows run out, my fatherâ€™s care taker, my mother, have to go back to poly to request for a new sheet. Worrying the safety of mother, I decided to recreate the form in excel and make hard copies of it. 

I also notice the form provided by the polyclinic is compact. The cells for the readings are small. The readings would not be easy to write and if all rows have been populated, it would not be clear to read. So I made sure that the form I created is spaced out so the readings is presentable.

Creating the form made me think about making the whole process easier. I would like to digitise the process of recording and displaying the records in an elderly friendly manner. While that is the primary objective, I would also utility features like appointment recording and reminder.
